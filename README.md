# Simple Shell

### Introduction
This repository is a [ALX-Holberton School] Project. The project consisted in writing a sh like shell, in **C**, using a limited number of standard library functions, So we used some of our own functions that we wrote over the past months and adapted them where required.

The goal in this project was to make us understand how a shell works. To single out some items: what is the *environment*, the difference between *functions* and *system calls*, how to create *processes* using `execve` and more.
